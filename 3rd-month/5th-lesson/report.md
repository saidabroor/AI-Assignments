# Steel Production Load Type Classification â€” Project Report

**Project Overview**
This project aims to build a classification model that predicts the load type in a steel production process based on various process-related features. The dataset consists of 35,040 records and 11 columns containing information such as timestamps, process variables, and the target class Load_Type.

**Dataset Information**

- Total records: 35,040
- Number of features: 11
- Target variable: Load_Type (categorical)

**Date-Time Feature Engineering**
Converted the date column to Pandas DateTime using pd.to_datetime so that model could better learn.

Extracted new features:

- year
- month
- day
- hour
- minute

**Data Preprocessing**

**Target Encoding for target value**
Mapped the Load_Type categories to numerical labels manually to avoid misencoding.
**Used LabelEncoder** to properly encode the target labels.

**Skewness Check & Scaling**

Checked the skewness of numerical columns to decide on the appropriate scaling strategy.

Applied **StandardScaler** to numerical features.

Excluded the target variable Load_Type from scaling to avoid converting it to float values, which would cause the classifier to behave like a regressor.

**Model training**

Used a **Random Forest Classifier** for initial model training.

Evaluated model using:

Classification Report (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), Confusion Matrix and Initial Results
Accuracy: ~40%

Visualized mistakes using ConfusionMatrixDisplay to identify class-wise errors.

**Model Improvement**
Data Balancing
Applied SMOTE to balance class distribution in the training set.

Retrained the Random Forest Classifier.

**Improved Results**
Accuracy increased by 4%, improving from 40% to 44%.

Final confusion matrix and classification report confirmed a better balance in predictions across the target classes.

**Summary**

- Diagnosing class imbalance problems
- Applying data balancing techniques like SMOTE
- Iteratively evaluating and refining the model
